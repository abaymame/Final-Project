    <h3> My Coding Experience </h3>
    <p>
      I am currently a freshman at Rhode Island School of Design, so I have not had much say in what I want to study here yet. The skill of coding is a relatively new thing to me. I have had some prior expierence with format of web pages from my internship at RightPoint Counselling LLC. With a better understanding of coding, I hope to use these skills when entering the Graphic Design program here at Rhode Island School of Design.
